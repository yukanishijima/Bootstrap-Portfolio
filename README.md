## Bootstrap-Portfolio
Responsiveness Assignment from Coding Boot Camp: Assignment One  
I used Bootstrap to make the Basic-Portfolio site responsive.  

### Overview

In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be building
your portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. The second will be enhancing
the portfolio you made last unit with a mobile-responsive layout.

#### Assignment One Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

  * A navbar

  * A responsive layout (remember the grid, rows and columns are your friends)

    * eg. On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right side of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device versus your computer to see this in action!

  * Responsive images

  **BONUS**
  Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site _(Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation)_

3. Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

4. Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.
